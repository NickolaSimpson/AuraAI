<h1>Predicting Migraine Onset Using Wearable Biometric and Environmental Data</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains code and documentation for a wearable migraine prediction system that leverages physiological and environmental data to detect early signs of migraine onset. The system integrates data from biometric sensors (heart rate, skin temperature, brain activity) and environmental factors (light, noise, air pressure) to predict migraine attacks before they occur.


<h2>Features</h2>
Real-time data collection from wearable sensors
Multi-sensor fusion to analyze biometric and environmental factors
Machine learning model for migraine onset prediction
User alerts to warn of potential migraine triggers
Data visualization for insights into migraine patterns


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Programming Languages: Python, C++
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Wearable Integration: Bluetooth, IoT APIs
Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly


<h2>Installation</h2>
Clone the repository:
https://github.com/NickolaSimpson/AuraAI.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

<h2>Usage</h2>
Run Data Collection Module


Train the Prediction Model


<h2>Data Sources</h2>
The system gathers data from:
Biometric Sensors: Heart rate monitors, EEG headbands, skin temperature sensors
Environmental Sensors: Light intensity sensors, noise level meters, barometers
